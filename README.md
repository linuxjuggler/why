# Why I have changed my username

I've had the username **@linuxjuggler** since ages, and I found out that now it is the time to switch to more formal name, so my new username is [@zaherg](https://github.com/zaherg).

And I wanted to keep my old name so that no one else can get it and keep it as a refrence to my new name.
